[12] And the earth brought forth grass, the herb that yields seed according to its kind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</row>
		<row book="1" chapter="1" verse="29" tag="">[29] And God said, “See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food.</row>
		<row book="1" chapter="4" verse="2" tag="">[2] Then she bore again, this time his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</row>
		<row book="1" chapter="8" verse="22" tag="">[22] “While the earth remains, Seedtime and harvest, Cold and heat, Winter and summer, And day and night Shall not cease.”</row>
		<row book="1" chapter="9" verse="20" tag="">[20] And Noah began to be a farmer, and he planted a vineyard.</row>
		<row book="1" chapter="27" verse="28" tag="">[28] Therefore may God give you Of the dew of heaven, Of the fatness of the earth, And plenty of grain and wine.</row>
		<row book="1" chapter="37" verse="7" tag="">[7] There we were, binding sheaves in the field. Then behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and indeed your sheaves stood all around and bowed down to my sheaf.”</row>
		<row book="2" chapter="22" verse="6" tag="">[6] “If fire breaks out and catches in thorns, so that stacked grain, standing grain, or the field is consumed, he who kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.</row>
		<row book="2" chapter="23" verse="10-11" tag="">[10] “Six years you shall sow your land and gather in its produce, [11] but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave, the beasts of the field may eat. In like manner you shall do with your vineyard and your olive grove.</row>
		<row book="3" chapter="11" verse="1-7" tag="">[1] Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them, [2] “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘These are the animals which you may eat among all the animals that are on the earth: [3] Among the animals, whatever divides the hoof, having cloven hooves and chewing the cud—that you may eat. [4] Nevertheless these you shall not eat among those that chew the cud or those that have cloven hooves: the camel, because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves, is unclean to you; [5] the rock hyrax, because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves, is unclean to you; [6] the hare, because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves, is unclean to you; [7] and the swine, though it divides the hoof, having cloven hooves, yet does not chew the cud, is unclean to you.</row>
		<row book="3" chapter="19" verse="19" tag="">[19] ‘You shall keep My statutes. You shall not let your livestock breed with another kind. You shall not sow your field with mixed seed. Nor shall a garment of mixed linen and wool come upon you.</row>
		<row book="3" chapter="19" verse="23-25" tag="">[23] ‘When you come into the land, and have planted all kinds of trees for food, then you shall count their fruit as uncircumcised. Three years it shall be as uncircumcised to you. It shall not be eaten. [24] But in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, a praise to the LORD. [25] And in the fifth year you may eat its fruit, that it may yield to you its increase: I am the LORD your God.</row>
		<row book="3" chapter="23" verse="22" tag="">[22] ‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field when you reap, nor shall you gather any gleaning from your harvest. You shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God.’ ”</row>
		<row book="3" chapter="25" verse="2" tag="">[2] “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When you come into the land which I give you, then the land shall keep a sabbath to the LORD.</row>

		<row book="5" chapter="8" verse="10" tag="">[10] When you have eaten and are full, then you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which He has given you.</row>
		<row book="5" chapter="11" verse="13-15" tag="">[13] ‘And it shall be that if you earnestly obey My commandments which I command you today, to love the LORD your God and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul, [14] then I will give you the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil. [15] And I will send grass in your fields for your livestock, that you may eat and be filled.’</row>
		<row book="5" chapter="22" verse="9-11" tag="">[9] “You shall not sow your vineyard with different kinds of seed, lest the yield of the seed which you have sown and the fruit of your vineyard be defiled.

		<row book="5" chapter="24" verse="19-21" tag="">[19] “When you reap your harvest in your field, and forget a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it; it shall be for the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. [20] When you beat your olive trees, you shall not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow. [21] When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward; it shall be for the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow.</row>
		<row book="5" chapter="28" verse="8" tag="">[8] “The LORD will command the blessing on you in your storehouses and in all to which you set your hand, and He will bless you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you.</row>

		<row book="7" chapter="6" verse="11" tag="">[11] Now the Angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth tree which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, in order to hide it from the Midianites.</row>
		<row book="8" chapter="2" verse="3" tag="">[3] Then she left, and went and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</row>
		<row book="8" chapter="3" verse="2" tag="">[2] Now Boaz, whose young women you were with, is he not our relative? In fact, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.</row>
		<row book="11" chapter="19" verse="19" tag="">[19] So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he was with the twelfth. Then Elijah passed by him and threw his mantle on him.</row>
		<row book="13" chapter="28" verse="8" tag="">[8] Now therefore, in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, be careful to seek out all the commandments of the LORD your God, that you may possess this good land, and leave it as an inheritance for your children after you forever.</row>
		<row book="16" chapter="13" verse="15" tag="">[15] In those days I saw people in Judah treading wine presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I warned them about the day on which they were selling provisions.</row>
		<row book="18" chapter="1" verse="14" tag="">[14] and a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,</row>
		<row book="19" chapter="85" verse="12" tag="">[12] Yes, the LORD will give what is good; And our land will yield its increase.</row>
		<row book="19" chapter="104" verse="14" tag="">[14] He causes the grass to grow for the cattle, And vegetation for the service of man, That he may bring forth food from the earth,</row>
		<row book="20" chapter="27" verse="23-27" tag="">[23] Be diligent to know the state of your flocks, And attend to your herds; [24] For riches are not forever, Nor does a crown endure to all generations. [25] When the hay is removed, and the tender grass shows itself, And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in, [26] The lambs will provide your clothing, And the goats the price of a field; [27] You shall have enough goats’ milk for your food, For the food of your household, And the nourishment of your maidservants.</row>
		<row book="20" chapter="28" verse="19" tag="">[19] He who tills his land will have plenty of bread, But he who follows frivolity will have poverty enough!</row>
		<row book="20" chapter="31" verse="16" tag="">[16] She considers a field and buys it; From her profits she plants a vineyard.</row>
		<row book="21" chapter="11" verse="4-6" tag="">[4] He who observes the wind will not sow, And he who regards the clouds will not reap. [5] As you do not know what is the way of the wind, Or how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child, So you do not know the works of God who makes everything. [6] In the morning sow your seed, And in the evening do not withhold your hand; For you do not know which will prosper, Either this or that, Or whether both alike will be good.</row>
		<row book="22" chapter="2" verse="15" tag="">[15] Catch us the foxes, The little foxes that spoil the vines, For our vines have tender grapes.</row>
		<row book="23" chapter="5" verse="2" tag="">[2] He dug it up and cleared out its stones, And planted it with the choicest vine. He built a tower in its midst, And also made a winepress in it; So He expected it to bring forth good grapes, But it brought forth wild grapes.</row>
		<row book="23" chapter="5" verse="6" tag="">[6] I will lay it waste; It shall not be pruned or dug, But there shall come up briers and thorns. I will also command the clouds That they rain no rain on it.”</row>
		<row book="23" chapter="17" verse="5" tag="">[5] It shall be as when the harvester gathers the grain, And reaps the heads with his arm; It shall be as he who gathers heads of grain In the Valley of Rephaim.</row>
		<row book="23" chapter="17" verse="10-11" tag="">[10] Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, And have not been mindful of the Rock of your stronghold, Therefore you will plant pleasant plants And set out foreign seedlings; [11] In the day you will make your plant to grow, And in the morning you will make your seed to flourish; But the harvest will be a heap of ruins In the day of grief and desperate sorrow.</row>
		<row book="23" chapter="28" verse="24-29" tag="">[24] Does the plowman keep plowing all day to sow? Does he keep turning his soil and breaking the clods? [25] When he has leveled its surface, Does he not sow the black cummin And scatter the cummin, Plant the wheat in rows, The barley in the appointed place, And the spelt in its place? [26] For He instructs him in right judgment, His God teaches him. [27] For the black cummin is not threshed with a threshing sledge, Nor is a cartwheel rolled over the cummin; But the black cummin is beaten out with a stick, And the cummin with a rod.

[4] I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward, so that no animal could withstand him; nor was there any that could deliver from his hand, but he did according to his will and became great. [5] And as I was considering, suddenly a male goat came from the west, across the surface of the whole earth, without touching the ground; and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes. [6] Then he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing beside the river, and ran at him with furious power. [7] And I saw him confronting the ram; he was moved with rage against him, attacked the ram, and broke his two horns. There was no power in the ram to withstand him, but he cast him down to the ground and trampled him; and there was no one that could deliver the ram from his hand. [8] Therefore the male goat grew very great; but when he became strong, the large horn was broken, and in place of it four notable ones came up toward the four winds of heaven. [9] And out of one of them came a little horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Glorious Land. [10] And it grew up to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and some of the stars to the ground, and trampled them. [11] He even exalted himself as high as the Prince of the host; and by him the daily sacrifices were taken away, and the place of His sanctuary was cast down. [12] Because of transgression, an army was given over to the horn to oppose the daily sacrifices; and he cast truth down to the ground. He did all this and prospered. [13] Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who was speaking, “How long will the vision be, concerning the daily sacrifices and the transgression of desolation, the giving of both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled underfoot?” [14] And he said to me, “For two thousand three hundred days; then the sanctuary shall be cleansed.” [15] Then it happened, when I, Daniel, had seen the vision and was seeking the meaning, that suddenly there stood before me one having the appearance of a man. [16] And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the Ulai, who called, and said, “Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.” [17] So he came near where I stood, and when he came I was afraid and fell on my face; but he said to me, “Understand, son of man, that the vision refers to the time of the end.” [18] Now, as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me, and stood me upright. [19] And he said, “Look, I am making known to you what shall happen in the latter time of the indignation; for at the appointed time the end shall be. [20] The ram which you saw, having the two horns— they are the kings of Media and Persia. [21] And the male goat is the kingdom of Greece. The large horn that is between its eyes is the first king.

[11] And when they had come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshiped Him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. [12] Then, being divinely warned in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed for their own country another way. [13] Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him.” [14] When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt, [15] and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called My Son.” [16] Then Herod, when he saw that he was deceived by the wise men, was exceedingly angry; and he sent forth and put to death all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men. [17] Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying: [18] “A voice was heard in Ramah, Lamentation, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, Refusing to be comforted, Because they are no more.”</row>
		<row book="40" chapter="20" verse="25-28" tag="">[25] But Jesus called them to Himself and said,“You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them. [26] Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant. [27] And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave— [28] just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.”</row>

The virgin’s name was Mary. [28] And having come in, the angel said to her, “Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you; blessed are you among women!” [29] But when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and considered what manner of greeting this was. [30] Then the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. [31] And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name JESUS. [32] He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. [33] And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.” [34] Then Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I do not know a man?” [35] And the angel answered and said to her, “ The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God.</row>
		<row book="42" chapter="1" verse="39-47" tag="">[39] Now Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah, [40] and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. [41] And it happened, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. [42] Then she spoke out with a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! [43] But why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? [44] For indeed, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. [45] Blessed is she who believed, for there will be a fulfillment of those things which were told her from the Lord.” [46] And Mary said: “My soul magnifies the Lord, [47] And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.</row>
		<row book="42" chapter="2" verse="7-16" tag="">[7] And she brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. [8] Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. [9] And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid. [10] Then the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. [11] For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. [12] And this will be the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger.” [13] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying: [14] “Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace, goodwill toward men!” [15] So it was, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, “Let us now go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.” [16] And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the Babe lying in a manger.</row>

[28] And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues. [29] Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? [30] Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?

What do I still lack?” [21] Jesus said to him,“If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”</row>

No one isgood but One, that is, God. [19] You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not bear false witness,’‘Do not defraud,’‘Honor your father and your mother.’” [20] And he answered and said to Him, “Teacher, all these things I have kept from my youth.” [21] Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him,“One thing you lack: Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow Me.”</row>
		<row book="41" chapter="12" verse="28-34" tag="">[28] Then one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, “Which is the first commandment of all?” [29] Jesus answered him,“Thefirst of all the commandments is: ‘Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God, the LORD is one. [30] And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’This isthe first commandment. [31] And the second, like it, isthis: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’There is no other commandment greater than these.” [32] So the scribe said to Him, “Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other but He. [33] And to love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one’s neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.” [34] Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him,“You are not far from the kingdom of God.” But after that no one dared question Him.</row>
		<row book="41" chapter="12" verse="38" tag="">[38] Then He said to them in His teaching, “Beware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, lovegreetings in the marketplaces,</row>

		<row book="45" chapter="2" verse="12-13" tag="">[12] For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by the law [13] (for not the hearers of the law are just in the sight of God, but the doers of the law will be justified;</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="2" verse="15" tag="">[15] who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else excusing them )</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="3" verse="20-24" tag="">[20] Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin. [21] But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, [22] even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference; [23] for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, [24] being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="3" verse="28" tag="">[28] Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="3" verse="31" tag="">[31] Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="4" verse="14-17" tag="">[14] For if those who are of the law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise made of no effect, [15] because the law brings about wrath; for where there is no law there is no transgression. [16] Therefore it is of faith that it might be according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all [17] (as it is written, “I have made you a father of many nations”) in the presence of Him whom he believed—God, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did;</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="5" verse="6-8" tag="">[6] For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. [7] For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. [8] But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="5" verse="20-21" tag="">[20] Moreover the law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, [21] so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="6" verse="14-16" tag="">[14] For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace. [15] What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not! [16] Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one’s slaves whom you obey, whether of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness?</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="7" verse="5-12" tag="">[5] For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were aroused by the law were at work in our members to bear fruit to death. [6] But now we have been delivered from the law, having died to what we were held by, so that we should serve in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter. [7] What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, “You shall not covet.” [8] But sin, taking opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all manner of evil desire. For apart from the law sin was dead. [9] I was alive once without the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died. [10] And the commandment, which was to bring life, I found to bring death. [11] For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me. [12] Therefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="7" verse="21-25" tag="">[21] I find then a law, that evil is present with me, the one who wills to do good. [22] For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man. [23] But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. [24] O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? [25] I thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="8" verse="1-4" tag="">[1] There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. [2] For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. [3] For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, [4] that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="8" verse="31" tag="">[31] What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="10" verse="4" tag="">[4] For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="13" verse="8-10" tag="">[8] Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law. [9] For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not bear false witness,” “You shall not covet,” and if there is any other commandment, are all summed up in this saying, namely, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” [10] Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.</row>

		<row book="48" chapter="2" verse="16" tag="">[16] knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="2" verse="19-21" tag="">[19] For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. [20] I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. [21] I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died in vain.”</row>

Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified?

Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="3" verse="5-6" tag="">[5] Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, does He do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?— [6] just as Abraham “believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.”</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="3" verse="10" tag="">[10] For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.”</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="3" verse="13" tag="">[13] Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”),</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="3" verse="17-18" tag="">[17] And this I say, that the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect.

		<row book="48" chapter="3" verse="24-25" tag="">[24] Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. [25] But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</row>

		<row book="1" chapter="1" verse="20-21" tag="">[20] Then God said, “Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the firmament of the heavens.” [21] So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters abounded, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</row>
		<row book="1" chapter="1" verse="24" tag="">[24] Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth, each according to its kind”; and it was so.</row>
		<row book="1" chapter="2" verse="19-20" tag="">[19] Out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them.

		<row book="9" chapter="26" verse="21" tag="">[21] Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Return, my son David. For I will harm you no more, because my life was precious in your eyes this day. Indeed I have played the fool and erred exceedingly.”</row>
		<row book="15" chapter="9" verse="6" tag="">[6] And I said: “O my God, I am too ashamed and humiliated to lift up my face to You, my God; for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens.</row>
		<row book="15" chapter="10" verse="1-2" tag="">[1] Now while Ezra was praying, and while he was confessing, weeping, and bowing down before the house of God, a very large assembly of men, women, and children gathered to him from Israel; for the people wept very bitterly. [2] And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, spoke up and said to Ezra, “We have trespassed against our God, and have taken pagan wives from the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope in Israel in spite of this.</row>

[3] When I kept silent, my bones grew old Through my groaning all the day long. [4] For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; My vitality was turned into the drought of summer. Selah [5] I acknowledged my sin to You, And my iniquity I have not hidden. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,” And You forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah</row>

		<row book="40" chapter="9" verse="6-7" tag="">[6] But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins”—then He said to the paralytic,“Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.” [7] And he arose and departed to his house.</row>

		<row book="42" chapter="23" verse="39-43" tag="">[39] Then one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, “If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us.” [40] But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? [41] And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this Man has done nothing wrong.” [42] Then he said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.” [43] And Jesus said to him,“Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.”</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="17" verse="30" tag="">[30] Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent,</row>

		<row book="45" chapter="10" verse="9-10" tag="">[9] that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.

		<row book="46" chapter="11" verse="1-12" tag="">[1] Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ. [2] Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions just as I delivered them to you. [3] But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. [4] Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head. [5] But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for that is one and the same as if her head were shaved. [6] For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered. [7] For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. [8] For man is not from woman, but woman from man. [9] Nor was man created for the woman, but woman for the man. [10] For this reason the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. [11] Nevertheless, neither is man independent of woman, nor woman independent of man, in the Lord. [12] For as woman came from man, even so man also comes through woman; but all things are from God.</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="2" verse="20" tag="">[20] I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.</row>

		<row book="58" chapter="11" verse="3" tag="">[3] By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="13" verse="6" tag="">[6] So we may boldly say: “The LORD is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?”</row>
		<row book="59" chapter="4" verse="7-10" tag="">[7] Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. [8] Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded. [9] Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. [10] Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up.</row>
		<row book="59" chapter="5" verse="16" tag="">[16] Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.</row>
		<row book="62" chapter="1" verse="8-10" tag="">[8] If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. [9] If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. [10] If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.</row>

		<row book="42" chapter="8" verse="27-39" tag="">[27] And when He stepped out on the land, there met Him a certain man from the city who had demons for a long time. And he wore no clothes, nor did he live in a house but in the tombs. [28] When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before Him, and with a loud voice said, “What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!” [29] For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had often seized him, and he was kept under guard, bound with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness. [30] Jesus asked him, saying,“What is your name?” And he said, “Legion,” because many demons had entered him. [31] And they begged Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss. [32] Now a herd of many swine was feeding there on the mountain. So they begged Him that He would permit them to enter them. And He permitted them. [33] Then the demons went out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the lake and drowned. [34] When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country. [35] Then they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid. [36] They also who had seen it told them by what means he who had been demon-possessed was healed. [37] Then the whole multitude of the surrounding region of the Gadarenes asked Him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. And He got into the boat and returned. [38] Now the man from whom the demons had departed begged Him that he might be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying, [39] “Return to your own house, and tell what great things God has done for you.”And he went his way and proclaimed throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.</row>

[20] Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, butratherrejoice because your names are written in heaven.”</row>

But Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.” And he came out that very hour.

Have You come here to torment us before the time?” [30] Now a good way off from them there was a herd of many swine feeding.

		<row book="40" chapter="17" verse="20" tag="">[20] So Jesus said to them,“Because of yourunbelief;for assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.</row>
		<row book="40" chapter="21" verse="21-22" tag="">[21] So Jesus answered and said to them,“Assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, ‘Be removed and be cast into the sea,’ it will be done. [22] And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”</row>
		<row book="41" chapter="4" verse="38-41" tag="">[38] But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. And they awoke Him and said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?” [39] Then He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace,be still!”And the wind ceased and there was a great calm. [40] But He said to them,“Why are you so fearful? How is itthat you have no faith?” [41] And they feared exceedingly, and said to one another, “Who can this be, that even the wind and the sea obey Him!”</row>
		<row book="41" chapter="5" verse="36" tag="">[36] As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of the synagogue,“Do not be afraid; only believe.”</row>
		<row book="41" chapter="9" verse="23" tag="">[23] Jesus said to him, “Ifyou can believe,all things arepossible to him who believes.”</row>

		<row book="41" chapter="11" verse="22-24" tag="">[22] So Jesus answered and said to them,“Have faith in God. [23] For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be removed and be cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says. [24] Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them,and you will have them.</row>
		<row book="41" chapter="16" verse="16" tag="">[16] He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.</row>

		<row book="42" chapter="17" verse="5-6" tag="">[5] And the apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.” [6] So the Lord said,“If you have faith as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.</row>

		<row book="44" chapter="11" verse="22-24" tag="">[22] Then news of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch.

		<row book="44" chapter="14" verse="9-10" tag="">[9] This man heard Paul speaking. Paul, observing him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed, [10] said with a loud voice, “Stand up straight on your feet!” And he leaped and walked.</row>

		<row book="44" chapter="15" verse="8-9" tag="">[8] So God, who knows the heart, acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us, [9] and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="16" verse="13" tag="">[13] And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the riverside, where prayer was customarily made; and we sat down and spoke to the women who met there.</row>

		<row book="45" chapter="1" verse="17" tag="">[17] For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, “The just shall live by faith.”</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="3" verse="22-31" tag="">[22] even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference; [23] for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, [24] being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, [25] whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed, [26] to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. [27] Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith. [28] Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law. [29] Or is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also, [30] since there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. [31] Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="4" verse="5" tag="">[5] But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness,</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="4" verse="16" tag="">[16] Therefore it is of faith that it might be according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="4" verse="20" tag="">[20] He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God,</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="4" verse="24" tag="">[24] but also for us. It shall be imputed to us who believe in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead,</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="5" verse="1-5" tag="">[1] Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, [2] through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. [3] And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; [4] and perseverance, character; and character, hope. [5] Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="8" verse="24-25" tag="">[24] For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees? [25] But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with perseverance.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="10" verse="9-10" tag="">[9] that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. [10] For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="10" verse="16-17" tag="">[16] But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “ LORD, who has believed our report?” [17] So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="12" verse="3" tag="">[3] For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="14" verse="1" tag="">[1] Receive one who is weak in the faith, but not to disputes over doubtful things.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="14" verse="22-23" tag="">[22] Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves. [23] But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not eat from faith; for whatever is not from faith is sin.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="15" verse="1" tag="">[1] We then who are strong ought to bear with the scruples of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="15" verse="13-14" tag="">[13] Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. [14] Now I myself am confident concerning you, my brethren, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</row>
		<row book="46" chapter="2" verse="5" tag="">[5] that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.</row>
		<row book="46" chapter="13" verse="2" tag="">[2] And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</row>
		<row book="46" chapter="13" verse="13" tag="">[13] And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</row>
		<row book="46" chapter="16" verse="13" tag="">[13] Watch, stand fast in the faith, be brave, be strong.</row>
		<row book="47" chapter="1" verse="24" tag="">[24] Not that we have dominion over your faith, but are fellow workers for your joy; for by faith you stand.</row>
		<row book="47" chapter="4" verse="13-14" tag="">[13] And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, “I believed and therefore I spoke,” we also believe and therefore speak, [14] knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus, and will present us with you.</row>
		<row book="47" chapter="5" verse="6-7" tag="">[6] So we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord. [7] For we walk by faith, not by sight.</row>
		<row book="47" chapter="13" verse="5" tag="">[5] Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you are disqualified.</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="2" verse="15-16" tag="">[15] We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, [16] knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="2" verse="20" tag="">[20] I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="3" verse="6-7" tag="">[6] just as Abraham “believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.” [7] Therefore know that only those who are of faith are sons of Abraham.</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="3" verse="9" tag="">[9] So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="3" verse="11-12" tag="">[11] But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for “the just shall live by faith.” [12] Yet the law is not of faith, but “the man who does them shall live by them.”</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="3" verse="21-22" tag="">[21] Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. [22] But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="3" verse="26" tag="">[26] For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="5" verse="5" tag="">[5] For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</row>
		<row book="49" chapter="2" verse="8" tag="">[8] For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,</row>
		<row book="49" chapter="3" verse="16-17" tag="">[16] that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, [17] that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,</row>
		<row book="49" chapter="6" verse="16" tag="">[16] above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.</row>
		<row book="52" chapter="1" verse="2-3" tag="">[2] We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers, [3] remembering without ceasing your work of faith, labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of our God and Father,</row>
		<row book="52" chapter="3" verse="5" tag="">[5] For this reason, when I could no longer endure it, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor might be in vain.</row>
		<row book="52" chapter="3" verse="7" tag="">[7] therefore, brethren, in all our affliction and distress we were comforted concerning you by your faith.</row>
		<row book="53" chapter="1" verse="3" tag="">[3] We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of every one of you all abounds toward each other,</row>
		<row book="53" chapter="1" verse="8" tag="">[8] in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.</row>
		<row book="53" chapter="3" verse="6" tag="">[6] But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition which he received from us.</row>
		<row book="54" chapter="1" verse="5" tag="">[5] Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from sincere faith,</row>
		<row book="54" chapter="1" verse="14" tag="">[14] And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.</row>
		<row book="54" chapter="1" verse="19" tag="">[19] having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck,</row>
		<row book="54" chapter="4" verse="1" tag="">[1] Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons,</row>
		<row book="54" chapter="4" verse="12" tag="">[12] Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</row>
		<row book="54" chapter="6" verse="11-12" tag="">[11] But you, O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness. [12] Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.</row>
		<row book="55" chapter="3" verse="15" tag="">[15] and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</row>
		<row book="55" chapter="4" verse="7-8" tag="">[7] I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. [8] Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="10" verse="22" tag="">[22] let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="10" verse="38-39" tag="">[38] Now the just shall live by faith; But if anyone draws back, My soul has no pleasure in him.” [39] But we are not of those who draw back to perdition, but of those who believe to the saving of the soul.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="11" verse="1-10" tag="">[1] Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. [2] For by it the elders obtained a good testimony. [3] By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible. [4] By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks. [5] By faith Enoch was taken away so that he did not see death, “and was not found, because God had taken him”; for before he was taken he had this testimony, that he pleased God. [6] But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. [7] By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith. [8] By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. [9] By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise; [10] for he waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="11" verse="17" tag="">[17] By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="11" verse="23" tag="">[23] By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s command.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="12" verse="2" tag="">[2] looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</row>
		<row book="59" chapter="1" verse="2-3" tag="">[2] My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, [3] knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.</row>
		<row book="59" chapter="1" verse="22-25" tag="">[22] But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. [23] For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; [24] for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. [25] But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does.</row>
		<row book="59" chapter="2" verse="14-26" tag="">[14] What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? [15] If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, [16] and one of you says to them, “Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? [17] Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. [18] But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. [19] You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble! [20] But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead? [21] Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? [22] Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect? [23] And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.” And he was called the friend of God. [24] You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only. [25] Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way? [26] For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</row>
		<row book="59" chapter="5" verse="15" tag="">[15] And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.</row>

[6] In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials, [7] that the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ, [8] whom having not seen you love. Though now you do not see Him, yet believing, you rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, [9] receiving the end of your faith—the salvation of your souls.</row>

[8] And his leaders gave willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites.

[5] But in accordance with your hardness and your impenitent heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, [6] who “will render to each one according to his deeds”: [7] eternal life to those who by patient continuance in doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality; [8] but to those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness—indignation and wrath,</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="2" verse="11-12" tag="">[11] For there is no partiality with God. [12] For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by the law</row>

[12] Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; [13] but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ’s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy. [14] If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified.

[49] The rest said, “Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to save Him.” [50] And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit. [51] Then, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split, [52] and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; [53] and coming out of the graves after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.

[45] Then the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two. [46] And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice, He said,“Father, ‘into Your hands I commit My spirit.’” Having said this, He breathed His last.

[17] For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.</row>
		<row book="43" chapter="12" verse="23-24" tag="">[23] But Jesus answered them, saying, “The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.

		<row book="43" chapter="18" verse="12-13" tag="">[12] Then the detachment of troops and the captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him. [13] And they led Him away to Annas first, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was high priest that year.</row>
		<row book="43" chapter="18" verse="38-39" tag="">[38] Pilate said to Him, “What is truth?” And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, “I find no fault in Him at all. [39] “But you have a custom that I should release someone to you at the Passover. Do you therefore want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”</row>
		<row book="43" chapter="19" verse="1-8" tag="">[1] So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him. [2] And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and they put on Him a purple robe. [3] Then they said, “Hail, King of the Jews!” And they struck Him with their hands. [4] Pilate then went out again, and said to them, “Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in Him.” [5] Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, “Behold the Man!” [6] Therefore, when the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, “Crucify Him, crucify Him! ” Pilate said to them, “You take Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in Him.” [7] The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God.” [8] Therefore, when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid,</row>
		<row book="43" chapter="19" verse="19-30" tag="">[19] Now Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. [20] Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. [21] Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but, ‘He said, “I am the King of the Jews.” ’ ” [22] Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.” [23] Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece. [24] They said therefore among themselves, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be,” that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: “They divided My garments among them, And for My clothing they cast lots.” Therefore the soldiers did these things. [25] Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. [26] When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, “Woman, behold your son!” [27] Then He said to the disciple,“Behold your mother!”And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home. [28] After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said,“I thirst!” [29] Now a vessel full of sour wine was sitting there; and they filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on hyssop, and put it to His mouth. [30] So when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, “It is finished!”And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.</row>
		<row book="43" chapter="19" verse="32-42" tag="">[32] Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with Him. [33] But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs. [34] But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. [35] And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you may believe. [36] For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, “Not one of His bones shall be broken.” [37] And again another Scripture says, “They shall look on Him whom they pierced.” [38] After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took the body of Jesus. [39] And Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds. [40] Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in strips of linen with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury. [41] Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. [42] So there they laid Jesus, because of the Jews’ Preparation Day, for the tomb was nearby.</row>

		<row book="45" chapter="3" verse="23-24" tag="">[23] for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, [24] being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="4" verse="16" tag="">[16] Therefore it is of faith that it might be according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="5" verse="1-2" tag="">[1] Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, [2] through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="5" verse="6-8" tag="">[6] For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. [7] For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. [8] But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="5" verse="15-21" tag="">[15] But the free gift is not like the offense. For if by the one man’s offense many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many. [16] And the gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned. For the judgment which came from one offense resulted in condemnation, but the free gift which came from many offenses resulted in justification. [17] For if by the one man’s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.) [18] Therefore, as through one man’s offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man’s righteous act the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life. [19] For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous. [20] Moreover the law entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, [21] so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="6" verse="1-4" tag="">[1] What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? [2] Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it? [3] Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? [4] Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="6" verse="14-16" tag="">[14] For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace. [15] What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not! [16] Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one’s slaves whom you obey, whether of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness?</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="6" verse="22-23" tag="">[22] But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves of God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, everlasting life. [23] For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="8" verse="1-4" tag="">[1] There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. [2] For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. [3] For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, [4] that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="8" verse="11" tag="">[11] But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="8" verse="15-16" tag="">[15] For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.” [16] The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,</row>

		<row book="45" chapter="9" verse="14-16" tag="">[14] What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? Certainly not! [15] For He says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.” [16] So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="10" verse="9" tag="">[9] that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.</row>
		<row book="45" chapter="11" verse="5-6" tag="">[5] Even so then, at this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace.

		<row book="45" chapter="12" verse="1-3" tag="">[1] I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.

[3] For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith.</row>

[18] Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation, [19] that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.</row>
		<row book="47" chapter="12" verse="8-10" tag="">[8] Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me. [9] And He said to me,“My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.”Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. [10] Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="1" verse="15" tag="">[15] But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through His grace,</row>

		<row book="48" chapter="2" verse="19-21" tag="">[19] For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. [20] I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. [21] I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died in vain.”</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="3" verse="17-18" tag="">[17] And this I say, that the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect.

[4] Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white robes; and they had crowns of gold on their heads.

		<row book="48" chapter="3" verse="10-13" tag="">[10] For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.” [11] But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God is evident, for “the just shall live by faith.” [12] Yet the law is not of faith, but “the man who does them shall live by them.” [13] Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”),</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="3" verse="16" tag="">[16] Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises made. He does not say, “And to seeds,” as of many, but as of one, “And to your Seed,” who is Christ.</row>

		<row book="48" chapter="4" verse="22" tag="">[22] For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, the other by a freewoman.</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="4" verse="27" tag="">[27] For it is written: “Rejoice, O barren, You who do not bear! Break forth and shout, You who are not in labor! For the desolate has many more children Than she who has a husband.”</row>
		<row book="48" chapter="4" verse="30" tag="">[30] Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.”</row>
		<row book="49" chapter="5" verse="31-32" tag="">[31] “For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” [32] This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</row>
		<row book="51" chapter="3" verse="16" tag="">[16] Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</row>

		<row book="55" chapter="3" verse="15-17" tag="">[15] and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

		<row book="58" chapter="2" verse="6" tag="">[6] But one testified in a certain place, saying: “What is man that You are mindful of him, Or the son of man that You take care of him?</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="3" verse="7" tag="">[7] Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you will hear His voice,</row>

		<row book="58" chapter="4" verse="12" tag="">[12] For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</row>

		<row book="60" chapter="1" verse="24" tag="">[24] because “All flesh is as grass, And all the glory of man as the flower of the grass. The grass withers, And its flower falls away,</row>

		<row book="58" chapter="1" verse="1-3" tag="">[1] God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, [2] has in these last days spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds; [3] who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="2" verse="17" tag="">[17] Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="3" verse="2" tag="">[2] who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was faithful in all His house.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="4" verse="14-15" tag="">[14] Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. [15] For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="5" verse="1-10" tag="">[1] For every high priest taken from among men is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. [2] He can have compassion on those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is also subject to weakness. [3] Because of this he is required as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifices for sins. [4] And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called by God, just as Aaron was. [5] So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but it was He who said to Him: “You are My Son, Today I have begotten You.” [6] As He also says in another place: “You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek”; [7] who, in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications, with vehement cries and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and was heard because of His godly fear, [8] though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered. [9] And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him, [10] called by God as High Priest “according to the order of Melchizedek,”</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="6" verse="19-20" tag="">[19] This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters the Presence behind the veil, [20] where the forerunner has entered for us, even Jesus, having become High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="7" verse="1-3" tag="">[1] For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, [2] to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being translated “king of righteousness,” and then also king of Salem, meaning “king of peace,” [3] without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="7" verse="23-26" tag="">[23] Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing. [24] But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood. [25] Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them. [26] For such a High Priest was fitting for us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens;</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="8" verse="1-2" tag="">[1] Now this is the main point of the things we are saying: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, [2] a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man.</row>

[13] For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifies for the purifying of the flesh, [14] how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</row>

Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. [12] Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God. [13] These things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. [14] But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. [15] But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one.</row>

[3] Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit. [4] There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. [5] There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. [6] And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. [7] But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: [8] for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, [9] to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, [10] to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. [11] But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills. [12] For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. [13] For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body— whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and have all been made to drink into one Spirit. [14] For in fact the body is not one member but many.</row>

[3] Sorrow is better than laughter, For by a sad countenance the heart is made better. [4] The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, But the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. [5] It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise Than for a man to hear the song of fools. [6] For like the crackling of thorns under a pot, So is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity. [7] Surely oppression destroys a wise man’s reason, And a bribe debases the heart. [8] The end of a thing is better than its beginning; The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. [9] Do not hasten in your spirit to be angry, For anger rests in the bosom of fools. [10] Do not say, “Why were the former days better than these?” For you do not inquire wisely concerning this. [11] Wisdom is good with an inheritance, And profitable to those who see the sun. [12] For wisdom is a defense as money is a defense, But the excellence of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to those who have it. [13] Consider the work of God; For who can make straight what He has made crooked? [14] In the day of prosperity be joyful, But in the day of adversity consider: Surely God has appointed the one as well as the other, So that man can find out nothing that will come after him. [15] I have seen everything in my days of vanity: There is a just man who perishes in his righteousness, And there is a wicked man who prolongs life in his wickedness. [16] Do not be overly righteous, Nor be overly wise: Why should you destroy yourself? [17] Do not be overly wicked, Nor be foolish: Why should you die before your time? [18] It is good that you grasp this, And also not remove your hand from the other; For he who fears God will escape them all. [19] Wisdom strengthens the wise More than ten rulers of the city. [20] For there is not a just man on earth who does good And does not sin. [21] Also do not take to heart everything people say, Lest you hear your servant cursing you. [22] For many times, also, your own heart has known That even you have cursed others. [23] All this I have proved by wisdom. I said, “I will be wise”; But it was far from me. [24] As for that which is far off and exceedingly deep, Who can find it out? [25] I applied my heart to know, To search and seek out wisdom and the reason of things, To know the wickedness of folly, Even of foolishness and madness. [26] And I find more bitter than death The woman whose heart is snares and nets, Whose hands are fetters. He who pleases God shall escape from her, But the sinner shall be trapped by her. [27] Here is what I have found,” says the Preacher, “ Adding one thing to the other to find out the reason, [28] Which my soul still seeks but I cannot find: One man among a thousand I have found, But a woman among all these I have not found.

[5] For to which of the angels did He ever say: “You are My Son, Today I have begotten You”? And again: “I will be to Him a Father, And He shall be to Me a Son”? [6] But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: “Let all the angels of God worship Him.”</row>

		<row book="58" chapter="5" verse="5-9" tag="">[5] So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but it was He who said to Him: “You are My Son, Today I have begotten You.” [6] As He also says in another place: “You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek”; [7] who, in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications, with vehement cries and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and was heard because of His godly fear, [8] though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.

[5] Do not deprive one another except with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</row>
		<row book="46" chapter="7" verse="8" tag="">[8] But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain even as I am;</row>
		<row book="46" chapter="7" verse="10-16" tag="">[10] Now to the married I command, yet not I but the Lord: A wife is not to depart from her husband. [11] But even if she does depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband is not to divorce his wife. [12] But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If any brother has a wife who does not believe, and she is willing to live with him, let him not divorce her. [13] And a woman who has a husband who does not believe, if he is willing to live with her, let her not divorce him. [14] For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy. [15] But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases. But God has called us to peace. [16] For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?</row>
		<row book="46" chapter="7" verse="25-40" tag="">[25] Now concerning virgins: I have no commandment from the Lord; yet I give judgment as one whom the Lord in His mercy has made trustworthy. [26] I suppose therefore that this is good because of the present distress— that it is good for a man to remain as he is: [27] Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife. [28] But even if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such will have trouble in the flesh, but I would spare you. [29] But this I say, brethren, the time is short, so that from now on even those who have wives should be as though they had none, [30] those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess, [31] and those who use this world as not misusing it. For the form of this world is passing away. [32] But I want you to be without care. He who is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord—how he may please the Lord. [33] But he who is married cares about the things of the world—how he may please his wife. [34] There is a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world—how she may please her husband. [35] And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a leash on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction. [36] But if any man thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of youth, and thus it must be, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin; let them marry. [37] Nevertheless he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so determined in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well. [38] So then he who gives her in marriage does well, but he who does not give her in marriage does better. [39] A wife is bound by law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is at liberty to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord. [40] But she is happier if she remains as she is, according to my judgment—and I think I also have the Spirit of God.</row>

[5] For in this manner, in former times, the holy women who trusted in God also adorned themselves, being submissive to their own husbands, [6] as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose daughters you are if you do good and are not afraid with any terror.

[3] And this we will do if God permits. [4] For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit,</row>

[4] One generation passes away, and another generation comes; But the earth abides forever. [5] The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, And hastens to the place where it arose. [6] The wind goes toward the south, And turns around to the north; The wind whirls about continually, And comes again on its circuit. [7] All the rivers run into the sea, Yet the sea is not full; To the place from which the rivers come, There they return again. [8] All things are full of labor; Man cannot express it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, Nor the ear filled with hearing. [9] That which has been is what will be, That which is done is what will be done, And there is nothing new under the sun. [10] Is there anything of which it may be said, “See, this is new”? It has already been in ancient times before us. [11] There is no remembrance of former things, Nor will there be any remembrance of things that are to come By those who will come after. [12] I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. [13] And I set my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven; this burdensome task God has given to the sons of man, by which they may be exercised. [14] I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and indeed, all is vanity and grasping for the wind. [15] What is crooked cannot be made straight, And what is lacking cannot be numbered. [16] I communed with my heart, saying, “Look, I have attained greatness, and have gained more wisdom than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My heart has understood great wisdom and knowledge.” [17] And I set my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is grasping for the wind.

[13] If the household is worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.

		<row book="42" chapter="6" verse="12-16" tag="">[12] Now it came to pass in those days that He went out to the mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God. [13] And when it was day, He called His disciples to Himself; and from them He chose twelve whom He also named apostles: [14] Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew; [15] Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot; [16] Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot who also became a traitor.</row>
		<row book="42" chapter="6" verse="39" tag="">[39] And He spoke a parable to them: “Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into the ditch?</row>
		<row book="42" chapter="9" verse="2-6" tag="">[2] He sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.

		<row book="42" chapter="24" verse="47" tag="">[47] and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</row>
		<row book="43" chapter="3" verse="17" tag="">[17] For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.</row>

		<row book="44" chapter="5" verse="19-20" tag="">[19] But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said, [20] “Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life.”</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="6" verse="1-4" tag="">[1] Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a complaint against the Hebrews by the Hellenists, because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution. [2] Then the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, “It is not desirable that we should leave the word of God and serve tables. [3] Therefore, brethren, seek out from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business; [4] but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="8" verse="4-5" tag="">[4] Therefore those who were scattered went everywhere preaching the word. [5] Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them.</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="8" verse="12" tag="">[12] But when they believed Philip as he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were baptized.</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="8" verse="26-29" tag="">[26] Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, “Arise and go toward the south along the road which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” This is desert. [27] So he arose and went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasury, and had come to Jerusalem to worship, [28] was returning. And sitting in his chariot, he was reading Isaiah the prophet. [29] Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go near and overtake this chariot.”</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="9" verse="10-11" tag="">[10] Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and to him the Lord said in a vision,“Ananias.” And he said, “Here I am, Lord.” [11] So the Lord said to him,“Arise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for onecalled Saul of Tarsus, for behold, he is praying.</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="9" verse="15" tag="">[15] But the Lord said to him,“Go, for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the childrenof Israel.</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="10" verse="19-20" tag="">[19] While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are seeking you. [20] Arise therefore, go down and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.”</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="11" verse="12" tag="">[12] Then the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man’s house.</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="11" verse="19-24" tag="">[19] Now those who were scattered after the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to no one but the Jews only. [20] But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus. [21] And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord. [22] Then news of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch. [23] When he came and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord. [24] For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord.</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="13" verse="2" tag="">[2] As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, “Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="13" verse="47" tag="">[47] For so the Lord has commanded us: ‘I have set you as a light to the Gentiles, That you should be for salvation to the ends of the earth.’ ”</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="13" verse="50-51" tag="">[50] But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, raised up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region. [51] But they shook off the dust from their feet against them, and came to Iconium.</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="14" verse="27" tag="">[27] Now when they had come and gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="16" verse="6-10" tag="">[6] Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia. [7] After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them. [8] So passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas. [9] And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. A man of Macedonia stood and pleaded with him, saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.” [10] Now after he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="18" verse="9-11" tag="">[9] Now the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision,“Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not keep silent; [10] for I am with you, and no one will attack you to hurt you; for I have many people in this city.” [11] And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="20" verse="18-21" tag="">[18] And when they had come to him, he said to them: “You know, from the first day that I came to Asia, in what manner I always lived among you, [19] serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears and trials which happened to me by the plotting of the Jews; [20] how I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house, [21] testifying to Jews, and also to Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="20" verse="24" tag="">[24] But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="21" verse="8" tag="">[8] On the next day we who were Paul’s companions departed and came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.</row>

And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? [15] And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, Who bring glad tidings of good things!” [16] But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “ LORD, who has believed our report?” [17] So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</row>

[17] Therefore I have reason to glory in Christ Jesus in the things which pertain to God. [18] For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not accomplished through me, in word and deed, to make the Gentiles obedient— [19] in mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. [20] And so I have made it my aim to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another man’s foundation,</row>

		<row book="46" chapter="1" verse="26-28" tag="">[26] For you see your calling, brethren, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called. [27] But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty; [28] and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are,</row>
		<row book="46" chapter="2" verse="1-5" tag="">[1] And I, brethren, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God.

[4] And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, [5] that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.</row>

That when I preach the gospel, I may present the gospel of Christ without charge, that I may not abuse my authority in the gospel. [19] For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win the more; [20] and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might win those who are under the law; [21] to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law; [22] to the weak I became as weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. [23] Now this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I may be partaker of it with you.</row>

Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought Peter in. [17] Then the servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, “You are not also one of this Man’s disciples, are you?” He said, “I am not.” [18] Now the servants and officers who had made a fire of coals stood there, for it was cold, and they warmed themselves. And Peter stood with them and warmed himself. [19] The high priest then asked Jesus about His disciples and His doctrine.</row>
		<row book="43" chapter="19" verse="15-16" tag="">[15] But they cried out, “Away with Him, away with Him! Crucify Him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!” [16] Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified.

But the high priest and those with him came and called the council together, with all the elders of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. [22] But when the officers came and did not find them in the prison, they returned and reported, [23] saying, “Indeed we found the prison shut securely, and the guards standing outside before the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside!” [24] Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these things, they wondered what the outcome would be. [25] So one came and told them, saying, “Look, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!” [26] Then the captain went with the officers and brought them without violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned. [27] And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest asked them, [28] saying, “Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name? And look, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this Man’s blood on us!”</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="6" verse="7" tag="">[7] Then the word of God spread, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith.</row>
		<row book="44" chapter="22" verse="5" tag="">[5] as also the high priest bears me witness, and all the council of the elders, from whom I also received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus to bring in chains even those who were there to Jerusalem to be punished.</row>

		<row book="58" chapter="4" verse="14-15" tag="">[14] Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. [15] For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="5" verse="1-10" tag="">[1] For every high priest taken from among men is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. [2] He can have compassion on those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is also subject to weakness. [3] Because of this he is required as for the people, so also for himself, to offer sacrifices for sins. [4] And no man takes this honor to himself, but he who is called by God, just as Aaron was. [5] So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but it was He who said to Him: “You are My Son, Today I have begotten You.” [6] As He also says in another place: “You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek”; [7] who, in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications, with vehement cries and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and was heard because of His godly fear, [8] though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered. [9] And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him, [10] called by God as High Priest “according to the order of Melchizedek,”</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="6" verse="20" tag="">[20] where the forerunner has entered for us, even Jesus, having become High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="7" verse="1-5" tag="">[1] For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, [2] to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being translated “king of righteousness,” and then also king of Salem, meaning “king of peace,” [3] without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually. [4] Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils. [5] And indeed those who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to receive tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brethren, though they have come from the loins of Abraham;</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="7" verse="11-17" tag="">[11] Therefore, if perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be called according to the order of Aaron? [12] For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there is also a change of the law. [13] For He of whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no man has officiated at the altar. [14] For it is evident that our Lord arose from Judah, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood. [15] And it is yet far more evident if, in the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest [16] who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life. [17] For He testifies: “You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek.”</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="7" verse="20-28" tag="">[20] And inasmuch as He was not made priest without an oath [21] (for they have become priests without an oath, but He with an oath by Him who said to Him: “The LORD has sworn And will not relent, ‘You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek’ ”), [22] by so much more Jesus has become a surety of a better covenant. [23] Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing. [24] But He, because He continues forever, has an unchangeable priesthood. [25] Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them. [26] For such a High Priest was fitting for us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens; [27] who does not need daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the people’s, for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. [28] For the law appoints as high priests men who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, appoints the Son who has been perfected forever.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="8" verse="1-6" tag="">[1] Now this is the main point of the things we are saying: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, [2] a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man. [3] For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this One also have something to offer. [4] For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law; [5] who serve the copy and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to make the tabernacle. For He said, “See that you make all things according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.” [6] But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="9" verse="6" tag="">[6] Now when these things had been thus prepared, the priests always went into the first part of the tabernacle, performing the services.</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="9" verse="25-26" tag="">[25] not that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood of another— [26] He then would have had to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now, once at the end of the ages, He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.</row>
		<row book="60" chapter="2" verse="9" tag="">[9] But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;</row>

[8] But He knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand,“Arise and stand here.”And he arose and stood.

		<row book="42" chapter="23" verse="54-56" tag="">[54] That day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew near.

		<row book="43" chapter="5" verse="16-18" tag="">[16] For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath. [17] But Jesus answered them, “My Father has been working until now, and I have been working.” [18] Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God.</row>
		<row book="43" chapter="7" verse="21-23" tag="">[21] Jesus answered and said to them,“I did one work, and you all marvel.

		<row book="43" chapter="9" verse="14-16" tag="">[14] Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes. [15] Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight.

		<row book="43" chapter="19" verse="31" tag="">[31] Therefore, because it was the Preparation Day, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</row>

		<row book="56" chapter="2" verse="1-12" tag="">[1] But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine: [2] that the older men be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience; [3] the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things— [4] that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, [5] to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed. [6] Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded, [7] in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility, [8] sound speech that cannot be condemned, that one who is an opponent may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you. [9] Exhort bondservants to be obedient to their own masters, to be well pleasing in all things, not answering back, [10] not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things. [11] For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, [12] teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age,</row>
		<row book="58" chapter="5" verse="12" tag="">[12] For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food.</row>

		<row book="58" chapter="12" verse="9-11" tag="">[9] Furthermore, we have had human fathers who corrected us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live? [10] For they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed best to them, but He for our profit, that we may be partakers of His holiness. [11] Now no chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.</row>
		<row book="59" chapter="3" verse="1" tag="">[1] My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment.</row>
		<row book="60" chapter="3" verse="15" tag="">[15] But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;</row>
		<row book="60" chapter="3" verse="18-19" tag="">[18] For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit, [19] by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,</row>
		<row book="60" chapter="4" verse="10-11" tag="">[10] As each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. [11] If anyone speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God. If anyone ministers, let him do it as with the ability which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever.

[3] By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction does not slumber.

[46] So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, [47] praising God and having favor with all the people.

[4] For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function, [5] so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another. [6] Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, let us prophesy in proportion to our faith; [7] or ministry, let us use it in our ministering; he who teaches, in teaching; [8] he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. [9] Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil. Cling to what is good. [10] Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor giving preference to one another;</row>

[13] For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body— whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and have all been made to drink into one Spirit. [14] For in fact the body is not one member but many. [15] If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body,” is it therefore not of the body? [16] And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body,” is it therefore not of the body? [17] If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling? [18] But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He pleased. [19] And if they were all one member, where would the body be? [20] But now indeed there are many members, yet one body. [21] And the eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you”; nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.” [22] No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary. [23] And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable parts have greater modesty, [24] but our presentable parts have no need. But God composed the body, having given greater honor to that part which lacks it, [25] that there should be no schism in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.</row>

For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will dwell in them And walk among them.
